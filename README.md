# Welcome ðŸ‘‹

This project was proposed after a first round interview as an introduction to Angular.

Thank you _**Anonymous Company**_ for the opportunity to interview with you and welcome to my project!

## Introduction

During the interview I was asked about my `process of learning` new technologies and in approaching this project I realized that I missed an important part of my process. I have increasingly starting learning new technologies by finding a highly rated course online. Even if the course is centered around building a project (vs just covering concepts) I will just watch the entire course (usually on 2x speed) and take **as many notes as possible**.

This allows me to become familiar with the lingo / buzzwords that are used when approaching different concepts within the particular technology at hand. Additionally, through my time at Lambda all of my notes are compiled into a private repo that I call my `codebrain`.

While continuously pausing the lecture or stopping the base project to take / update my notes initially slows down my progress, I have seen that in the long run it dramatically increases the speed my development. I am either able to immediately retrieve information which is already structured in my preferred format from my `codebrain` or I can better target the official documentation to learn more granular details as needed (and update my notes accordingly).

## Pre Submission Update

We were able to work through my dad being _absolutly sure_ that he only cut the cable (not the internet) while doing renovations on Saturday and a power outage Sunday to learn ALOT about Angular this weekend!

I look forward to being able to speak with you reguarding improvements that I can make!

1. Created `hero-search` component as nested child of `heroes` component
2. Added `<app-hero-search>` element to `dashboard` component
3. Updated `hero-search.html` to have:
    - input section => event bound to `search()` which passes an updated term to search when the input changes
    - result section => renders a list of results based on the response from the `heroes$` observable
4. `hero-search.ts` is utilizing `debounceTime` / `distinctUntilChanged` / `switchMap` inside its `ngOnInit()` to control the number of HTTP requests sent to `searchHeroes()` method in `heroesDataService`

</details>

<details>
<summary>0.8.0 - Update / Add / Delete Hero</summary>

1. Update => `hero-detail.html` & `hero-detail.ts`
    - Added Save button which is event bound to button click triggering`updateHero()` method which calls the `updateHero()` method on the `heroesDataService`

2. Add => `heroes.html` & heroes.ts`
    - Added input box for new hero name
    - Added Add button to pass local reference to #localName input into event bound `addHero()` method which calls the `addHero` method on the `heroesDataService`

3. Delete => `heroes.html` & heroes.ts`
    - Added `x` box on each hero `li` which is event bound to click and passing the hero into the `DeleteHero` method which calls the `deleteHero()` method on the `heroesDataDataService`

- All method in `heroesDataService` are:
    - Utilizing a `pipe` to handle errors
    - Utilizing a `tap` to call messageService

</details>

<details>
<summary>0.7.0 - Simulating HTTP Request w/ angular-in-memory-web-api</summary>

1. Creating @Injectable `InMemoryDataService` with imported mock array of Hero interface types
2. Updated `heroesData.service.ts`

        - Utilizing a `pipe` to handle errors
        - Utilizing a `tap` to call messageService which has been consolidated into a `private log()` util method

</details>

<details>
<summary>0.6.0 - Hero Detail Routing</summary>

1. Added `getHero(id)` method to `heroesDataService`
2. Added `detail/:id` route to `app-routing.module.ts`
3. Cleaned `heroes.component.html` & `heroes.component.ts` of any selection logic now that routerLink will send the user to the appropriate route
4. Updated `hero-detail.component.ts`
    - Getting selected hero ID from the `paramMap.get()` provided through  the `ActivatedRoute` import. ID is being passed into local `getHero()` method which is called in `ngOnInit()` and using `heroDataService.getHero()`
    - Added `goBack()` method to return to previous page through the `Location` import

2. `app.compoent.html`
    - Replaced `<app-heroes>` element with `<router-outlet>` element

</details>

<details>
<summary>0.3.1 - Heroes Data Service w/ RxJS Observable</summary>

1. `heroesData.service.ts` is now using RxJS with an `Observable` return type and simulate the asynchronous fetching of data
2. `heroes.component.ts` is subscribing to the returned `Observable` and only updating `this.heroes` when data is returned

</details>

<details>
<summary>0.3.0 - Heroes Data Service</summary>

1. Created `services` directory
    - Added `heroesData.service.ts`
        - `@Injectable()` created the service and defined its injector as the root injector
        - `getHeros()` is returning a mocked array of Hero interface types
    - `heroes.component.ts` is requesting an injection of the `herosData` service and using the service in the `ngInit()` lifecycle method

</details>

<details>
<summary>0.2.1 - Hero Detail SubComponent</summary>

1. `hero-detail` component is now responsible for all logic relating to a selected hero
    - `heroes.component.html` is using `one-way property binding` to pass a selectedHero to the `hero-detail` component
    - `hero-detail` is receiving the `one-way property binding` through an `@input()` which expects the passed data to be of the Hero interface type
2. `heros` is only responsible for displaying list of heros
