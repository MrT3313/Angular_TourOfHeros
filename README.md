# Welcome ðŸ‘‹

This project was proposed after a first round interview as an introduction to Angular.

Thank you _**Anonymous Company**_ for the opportunity to interview with you and welcome to my project!

During the interview I was asked about my `process of learning` new technolgies and would like to elaborate on my initial answer of `using the official documentation to work through small projects`. The truth is that I have actually added a step prior to diving into code or the official documentation.

I now usually start learning a new technology by finding a highly rated course online. Even if the course is centered around building a project I will just watch the entire course (usually on 2x speed) and take **as many notes as possible**

This allows me to become fermiliar with the lingo / buzzwords that are used when approaching different concepts within the particular technolgy at hand.

Additionally through my time at Lambda I have contributed to a private repo that I call my `codebrain`. While it slows down the initial process of going through the course or starting the small project I have seen **tremendous** value down the road when I am able to retrieve information much faster when returning to a technology that I have not worked with in some time.
